## Mainstreaming Wokeness, Thank you!

> "No news is bad new" P.T. Barnum

Without the stellar opposition to the merest social deviation from the 18th century world in which the whiners seem to exist *most* such social phases would dissapear in moments. 

The billions of people socially interconnected today haven't the attention span nor the inclination to *protest* 
- unless poked with a stick

Thank you! whiners for the "good kind of" poking.

> "Made possible by financial support to your local PBS station from... viewers like you" - since November, 1999.

THE most *woke* broadcast media empire on the planet! Started a couple years before the Watergate scandal awoke (May 17, 1973), during Nixon's (R) turn as POTUS. PBS' MacNeil/Lehrer dynamic duo broadcast the hearings during primetime.

## Anti-correctness empowers correctness

> "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you."
>> Joseph Heller, Catch-22 

Yes, anti-wokeness is the life-blood of any society that seeks to grow.

When the real whining begins is when anti-XYZ'ers have thrown in the towel, the phat happy rats abandon the sinking ship, today more than ever - at least since Nero and the fiddling days.

Do you feel the heat?

It is a "good kind of" heat.

## Pop Quiz!

No? Then you probably are *phat* white *square* and *totally* stuck in a different *wicked* world, in a not so *excellent* way, dudeness.

Sorry to hear that, kinda sucks *bad ass*.

The kids love you! as a bad dad-ass joke.

> "So I've got that going for me... which is nice."
